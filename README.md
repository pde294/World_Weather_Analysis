# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a beta version of a tool for recommending a potential travel itinerary based on weather preferences. This tool leverages the resources of OpenWeatherMap, Python, and Google Maps and Places.

The tool comes in three parts, outlined as follows with visuals:

 - A Weather_Database program (Deliverable 1) which retrieves current weather data (such as temperature, humidity, percent cloudiness, and windiness) from a randomized selection of 2000 cities. The following is an image of part of a randomized database that was an output of this program.

 - A Vacation_Search program (Deliverable 2) which allows us to see potential travel destinations, out of the randomized selection of 2000 cities in the Weather_Database output, based on current temperature preferences of customers. The following is an image of a map of potential travel destinations when the minimum temperature is selected to be "70" and the maximum temperature is selected to be "90".

 - Vacation_Itinerary program (Deliverable 3) which presents a recommended travel itinerary. The following is an image of a map of a potential travel itinerary including four cities based on the temperature preferences set in the Vacation_Search output.

Through future testing, more preferences that influence travel decisions can be determined and contribute to the development of a version 2.0 of this tool.
