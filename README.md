# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a beta version of a tool for recommending a potential travel itinerary based on weather preferences. This tool leverages the resources of OpenWeatherMap, Python, and Google Maps and Places.

The tool comes in three parts, outlined as follows with visuals:

 - A Weather_Database program which retrieves current weather data (such as temperature, humidity, percent cloudiness, and windiness) from a randomized selection of 2000 cities
 - A Vacation_Search program which allows us to see potential travel destinations based on customer temperature preferences
 - Vacation_Itinerary program which presents a recommended travel itinerary

It is hoped that through further testing, more preferences that influence travel decisions can be determined and contribute to the development of a version 2.0 of this tool.
